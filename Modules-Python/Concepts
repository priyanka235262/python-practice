#Modules in Python are essentially Python files that contain definitions and statements. They serve as organizational units for code, allowing you to break down larger programs into smaller, more manageable components. Modules promote code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.


#Key Concepts:

Module Definition: A Python file with a .py extension is considered a module.
Import Statement: To use the definitions from a module in another file, you use the import statement.
Module Namespace: Each module creates its own namespace, which is a mapping of names to objects. This helps avoid naming conflicts between different modules.



Import Methods:

Direct Import:

Import the entire module:
Python
import mymodule

Access definitions using dot notation:
Python
mymodule.function_name()
mymodule.variable_name

From-Import:

Import specific definitions:
Python
from mymodule import function_name, variable_name


Use the imported names directly:
Python
function_name()
variable_name

Import with Alias:

Assign an alias to the module:
Python
import mymodule as m

Use the alias to access definitions:
Python
m.function_name()
m.variable_name
