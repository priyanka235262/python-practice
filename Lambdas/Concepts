#Advantages of Lambda Functions:

Concise: Lambda functions provide a more concise way to write short functions.
Readability: In some cases, lambda functions can improve code readability by eliminating unnecessary function definitions.
Flexibility: They can be used as arguments to higher-order functions, making them versatile.
Disadvantages of Lambda Functions:

Limited Functionality: Lambda functions are limited to a single expression, making them less suitable for complex logic.
Readability: In some cases, lambda functions can make code harder to understand if they are overly complex.
Conclusion:

Lambda functions are a powerful tool in Python, offering a concise and flexible way to define anonymous functions. They are particularly useful for simple tasks and when used with higher-order functions. However, it's important to use them judiciously and consider their limitations to maintain code readability and maintainability.

#Syntax:

Python
lambda parameters: expression

#Example:

Python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)

Key Points:

Lambda functions are often used as arguments to other functions or when you need a quick, one-time function.
They are typically shorter and more concise than named functions, making them ideal for simple tasks.
Lambda functions can be used with higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce.


#Common Use Cases:

Sorting Lists:
Python
my_list = [(1, 'apple'), (3, 'banana'), (2, 'orange')]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=lambda x: x[0])
print(sorted_list)

Filtering Lists:
Python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)

Mapping Values:
Python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)
